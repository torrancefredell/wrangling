        "1. This paper is about a framework that can be used to \"tidy\" datasets by developing tools and streamlining processes for this purpose, so that datasets can be easily analyzed and visualized.\n",
        "2. The tidy data standard was made to simplify data exploration and analysis, as well as to condense the number of tools used in order to spend more time drawing valuable insights from data, rather than trying to figure out how to fix it up.\n",
        "3. The first quote, which compares happy vs. messy datasets and families, aims to share the message that all happy families and datasets are happy in one way; they do not have major issues, and as a result they are all similar, with a common structure. However, just as a family could appear messy because of any number of factors, datasets are the same; they could be messy because of too many missing pieces, faulty column/row naming methods, incorrect data types, etc. The second sentence refers to the complexities of understanding what is a variable versus observation in a dataset. This is difficult because variables and observations are very much defined in the context of the study that they are a part of, so it is difficult to say that they will universally \"look\" a certain way or describe certain things.\n",
        "4. Values are data points, of which the dataset is mainly comprised. Variables are the various attributes of whatever is being studied, and observations are the different units that are measured for each variable.\n",
        "5. Tidy data is defined as data that has three requirements: every variable and observation is its own column and row, respectively, and all of the observational units form the table itself.\n",
        "6. The five most common problems with messy datasets are as follows: column headers are values when they should be variable names, columns contain multiple variables, variables can be found in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are in one table, and/or an observational unit can be found in multiple tables. The data in table four are messy because the column headers are values when they should be variable names. The variables are religion, income, and frequency, but the column headers (income ranges) should correspond with values in one column titled \"income\" inside the table. Melting a dataset refers to the process of taking several columns and combining them into a single column with some 'variable' header, as well as an associated 'value' column, which contains the original columns' data. Each original column header is thus a value in the new variable column.  \n",
        "7. Dataset 11 is messy for a few reasons: first, it has an excessive number of blank spots, marked by \"--.\" Second, each day of the month has its own column, when they could instead be condensed down to a single \"dates\" column with an associated \"values\" column next to it. Dataset 12 is tidy and molten because the 30+ columns dedicated to the date have been condensed to one column, which has an associated value column.\n",
        "8. The \"chicken and egg\" problem refers to the problem where tidy data and tidy tools are interdependent; either one could come first, but realistically, neither one could be properly developed without the other. Therefore, they must be simultaneously adopted and advanced. In the future, Wickham hopes that scientists will build off of and improve the tidy data framework. Additionally, he hopes that tools that work with values stored in multidimensional arrays will be created, as well as tools that can choose between array-tidy and dataframe-tidy formats, for memory and performance sakes. Along with tidying, other tools that he mentions related to data cleaning include ones that could potentially find and missing values or typos, parse dates, work with international data, etc."

        "1. According to the US Census Bureau, race data is collected via self-identification, and individuals may choose to report more than one race group. They could check a box for things like \"White\" or \"African Am\" and then specify origin (\"Irish\" or \"Jamaican,\" for example) through print on the paper 2020 census.\n",
        "2. Race data are collected in order to aid governments and communities\n",
        "in their fight against discrimination. When used in conjunction with data related to housing, education, employment, etc., race data become a powerful tool to uncover inequalities that might otherwise be difficult to detect. These data collectively also allow for more just policy-making, since they help politicians understand demographic trends and the distribution of various resources. Good quality data is needed so that this entire process is accurate and so that policies can reflect the needs of the populations that they affect.\n",
        "3. I think that the Census did a good job of trying to make sure that people from all racial backgrounds could be accounted for. They not only offered opportunities for individuals to state their race, but also their specific origin. Additionally, people could choose more than one race, which was a positive step toward accomodating mixed-race people. One specific issue that I noticed was that the space for American Indian or Alaskan Native may be insufficient; it does not provide enough space even for the origin examples included on the Census. People belonging to these groups who see this may be confused or frustrated with this oversight, which could potentially lead to underreporting from those populations.\n",
        "4. The same inclusivity that was seen in the race section of the Census generally extended to queer individuals as well. However, I think there's room for improvement in how the Census addresses 'sex.' Given the evolving concept of gender diversity, the options of 'male' or 'female' may be too restrictive for some. To this point, incorporating a broader range of gender identities or perhaps adding a print-in section may be beneficial for the sake of political correctness. The makers of similar surveys could follow suit and adopt more open-ended, inclusive questions and options.\n",
        "5. When it comes to cleaning data, I am concerned that the aforementioned characteristics might be simplified into their overarching descriptors. For example, although someone writes in their specific origin, for the sake of data manipulation, scientists might just overgeneralize and say they are just a part of the broader category, and lose all distinction between various backgrounds. People who are not trained properly may introduce bias into the data when cleaning it. Additionally, missing values may cause problems because they would make it harder for data analysts to find patterns among and between connected data, and the statistical power of the dataset might be impacted. Good practices might include not adjusting certain data, such as that involved with race or sex, since the individuals who filled out the Census probably did it a certain way on purpose. These decisions can be documented so that analysts later on can understand why they were made. If imputation is necessary, it should be done in such a way that reflects the uncertainty in the dataset. Along with what was mentioned before, bad practice would include filling in data or throwing away essential pieces of data (overgeneralizing).\n",
        "6. If someone were to develop such an algorithm, I would have a few concerns: primarily, the imputed values might not reflect the affected individuals correctly, leading to misrepresentation. In turn, this could have consequences when it comes to policy making, as mentioned before. Misrepresentation can also reinforce stereotypes and marginalize certain minority groups. Additionally, I would worry that the algorithm would not adequately consider the dynamics of nuanced matters such as race or sex over time, which are influenced by personal experiences, cultural shifts, and/or social attitudes."
